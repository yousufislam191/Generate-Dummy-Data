# Generate Dummy Data with Customizable JSON Data

This project allows you to generate a large amount of dummy data based on your customizable JSON data. It's particularly useful when you need to test APIs, responses, or any other functionality that requires a significant amount of data.

## How to Use?

Follow these steps to use this project:

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Put your customized JSON data inside the `original_json` variable in the `originalJSON.py` file.
4. Open the terminal in the project directory.
5. Run the Python scripts in: `python writeJSON.py`
6. Check the `output.json` file in the project directory for your dummy data.

## Example

Let's assume you have a file named `user.json` in the `data` folder with the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```
